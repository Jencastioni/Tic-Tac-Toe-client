## Planning Story:
General Assembly's SEI program assigned a Tic-Tac-Toe game for our very first project and therefore required quite a bit of planning.

I created my Tic-Tac-Toe game using a single-page web application. As per the requirements, the game allows the user to create an account or sign up, sign in, change their password while signed in and sign out. The user must be signed in to play where they must start a "New Game" and can play a game by themselves or with a friend. The first move or player is "X" and it switches between "X" and "O" until a winner is declared or a draw.The user is unable to click on a space that has already been filled and cannot play on the board once a game is finished. To play again you hit, "Replay Game" and to check how many games have been played, simply click "Games Played."

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to create an account.
- As a user, I want to sign in to play.
- As a user, I want to change my password.
- As a user, I want to sign out.
- As a user, I want to start a new game.
- As a user, I want to click on a box and have it populate with "X" or "O".
- As a user, I want to know if I clicked on an empty space or if the move is invalid.
- As a user, I want to be shown when the game is over and if there was a win or draw.
- As a user, I want to track how many games I played.

## Technologies Used:
The following technologies were used to produce my application:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Ajax
- Bootstrap
- VS Code

## Unsolved Problems:
I would like to eventually play against a computer and keep track of "X" wins, "O" wins and Ties.
